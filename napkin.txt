* implement the different packet that will be sent for recovery
    * Include metadata in our packet (flight mode)
* pack the altitude data 

* When initializing radio head module we need to set the channel with the serial number  

* need two separate serial numbers from two separate addresses, one for channel and one for downlink time 

* llcc68 radio module instead
